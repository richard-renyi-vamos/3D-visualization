create a python script that lets you create 3d objects

Creating 3D objects in Python can be done using various libraries, each catering to different levels of complexity and functionality. One of the most popular and versatile libraries for this purpose is Blender, which is a powerful tool for 3D modeling, animation, and rendering. However, Blender has a steep learning curve and is typically used as a standalone application rather than a library in Python scripts.

For a more straightforward approach, you can use Python libraries like Pygame for basic 3D rendering or VTK (Visualization Toolkit) for more advanced 3D visualizations. I'll demonstrate a simple example using Pygame, which is primarily a 2D game library but can be used to render basic 3D shapes.

First, ensure you have Pygame installed. You can install it via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Then, here's a basic script to create a simple 3D object:

python
Copy code
import pygame
import math

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Create a display
width, height = 800, 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))

# Define colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

# 3D cube points
cube_points = [(-1, -1, -1), (1, -1, -1), (1, 1, -1), (-1, 1, -1),
               (-1, -1, 1), (1, -1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, 1)]

# Function to rotate points in space
def rotate_point(point, angle):
    x, y, z = point
    # Rotate around Y axis
    x, z = x * math.cos(angle) - z * math.sin(angle), x * math.sin(angle) + z * math.cos(angle)
    return x, y, z

# Function to project 3D points to 2D
def project_point(point):
    x, y, z = point
    # Simple perspective projection
    distance = 5
    f = 200 / (z + distance)
    x, y = x * f, y * f
    return int(width / 2 + x), int(height / 2 - y)

# Main loop
running = True
angle = 0
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Clear screen
    screen.fill(BLACK)

    # Update rotation angle
    angle += 0.01

    # Draw cube
    for i, point in enumerate(cube_points):
        rotated_point = rotate_point(point, angle)
        projected_point = project_point(rotated_point)
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, WHITE, projected_point, 5)

        # Draw lines between points to form edges of the cube
        for j in range(i, len(cube_points)):
            if sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(point, cube_points[j])) == 2:
                rotated_point_2 = rotate_point(cube_points[j], angle)
                projected_point_2 = project_point(rotated_point_2)
                pygame.draw.line(screen, WHITE, projected_point, projected_point_2, 1)

    # Update display
    pygame.display.flip()
    pygame.time.wait(10)

pygame.quit()
This script creates a rotating cube using Pygame. It's a basic example and serves as a starting point for more complex 3D graphics. For more advanced 3D programming in Python, you might want to delve into OpenGL bindings for Python or even use Blender's Python API for more sophisticated 3D modeling and rendering. üêçüñ•Ô∏èüé®
